Python Code Structure and Format (PEP8 guide)
- import statements go at the top and each have their own line
- indent with spaces not tabs and use 4 spaces for each indentation level
- limit lines to 79 characters and 72 for docstrings and commments
- seperate functions and classes by two blank lines
- within classes, seperate methods by one blank line
- No spaces around function calls, indexes, keyword arguments

Python Whitespace Conventions (some exampels)
- DO                         - DONT
* spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})    * spam(ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 })
* fn(arg)                    * fn (arg)
* i = i + 1                  * i=i+1
